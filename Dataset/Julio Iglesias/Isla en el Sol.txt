[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ verso ]
Si tú supieras que yo sin ti
Ya no he vuelto a ser como ayer
¿Que necesito para vivir
Que necesites de mi querer?

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ verso ]
Si tú supieras como yo sé
Que no puedo vivir sin ti
Que no he vuelto a saber querer
Desde aquel día en que te perdí

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ verso ]
Quiero vivir cerca del mar
Quiero estar solo junto a ti
Donde el amor ya no tenga edad
Donde el amor ya no tenga fin

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand

[ coro ]
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days, I will sing in praise
Of your forest water, your shining sand
